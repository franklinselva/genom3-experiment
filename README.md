# DRONE EXPERIMENT

## Installation

The easier way to setup repository is to launch the following command:

```bash
bash install-scripts/setup-experiment.sh --all
```

If we are expecting different operations, we can use the following command:

```bash
bash install-scripts/setup-experiment.sh --help
```

## Usage

To start the experiment, you need to launch the files from `run/` directory. For example, the following command starts the experiment with a single drone:

```bash
bash run/start-simu.sh
```
